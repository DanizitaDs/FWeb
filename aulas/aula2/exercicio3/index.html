        <p><b>"Minions" is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.</b>
            <br>In 2010, Illumination Entertainment released its first animated feature film,
            <br>"Despicable Me", about an evil genius named Gru who was struggling to stay on <br>top of the evil genius
            business, with the help of his pint-sized henchmen known <br>as minions. That film made over $250 million in
            the U.S. alone (almost quadruple <br>what it cost), so, naturally, there was a sequel. In 2013, "Despicable
            Me 2" <br>made over $368 million domestically and was rated by audiences as even better <br>than the
            original. The minions were a small big reason for all that. They were a <br>hit in the first film and they
            played a larger role in the second film, which <br>performed even better than the first, so, naturally, they
            got a movie of their <br>own.
        </p>

        <p><b>A pretty decent film!</b>
            <br>Minions was a pretty good film, I mean the animation was top notch, and the <br>jokes were very good (at
            some points). The main minions in the film Kevin, <br>Bob and Stuart were fairly funny at times, and the
            fact that they couldn't <br>speak English added another funny mark to it. If you have seen the
            <br>Despicable Me franchise, then you probably know who the minions are, but if <br>you haven't seen the
            Despicable Me franchise, then before you watch Minions, <br>I recommend you see Despicable Me 1 and 2, As
            that is where they were first <br>introduced to the world. Moving on, some villains in the film, seemed a
            bit <br>rushed just to get on with the movie, and some of them were unnecessary, but <br>overall they each
            had their own funny scenes. The main villain Scarlett <br>Overkill, had a crazy personality, and had some
            good humor which added a <br>nice ring to the film, as well as that the Minions were always there to mess
            <br>with her, So it was an action packed- family fun film.

        <p><b>Banana!!!
                Quickie Review:</b>

            <br></BR>Minions from the dawn of time have always searched to serve the <br>most despicable masters in the
            world. After failing to keep their <br>masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when
            <br>three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find <br>their new master.
            Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things <br>right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the
            adorable little <br>minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a <br>collection
            slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of <br>the minions. Instead, the creators of this
            film added heart to the <br>characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have <br>fun
            with.
